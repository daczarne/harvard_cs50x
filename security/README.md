# Security

Nothing in the cyber world is completely secure. There are levels of security.

## Brute-force attack

Trying multiple passwords with some program. These attacks might take a lot of time. For example, a 4-digit passcode will take, at most, 10,000 tries (the number of posible codes). If instead we use alphabet letters there are 7,311,616 (if case sensitive). If we use 4-character (all posible ascii characters) then there are over 78 million (94 x 94 x 94 x 94) passcodes.

## Two-Factor Authentication

Defense mechanism that depends not only on something you know (like a password), but also something you have (biometrics, or code generator apps).

## Password Managers

Software that generates and remembers passwords.

## Encryption

Use encryption, like `https://`. Better still use end-to-end-encryption to prevent intermediaries to look at the data.
